GitPress provides a widget for listing a GitHub user's repositories.

== Description ==

GitPress is a WordPress plugin that provides a widget for listing a GitHub user's repositories.

The widget also supports multiple instances just in case you're running a multi-author blog and you all want to show off your GitHub hotness.  =D

Follow the project on GitHub too!  http://github.com/enricob/gitpress

*NEW*: Now you can render the widget as a Dr. Nic GitHub badge. Unfortunately, only one badge can be rendered at a time.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `gitpress.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Use the widgets admin page to add GitPress widgets to your theme!
